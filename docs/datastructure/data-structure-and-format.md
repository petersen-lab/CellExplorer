## Data path and naming convention
CellExplorer uses one main path/directory for each session called `basepath`. Each session is identified by a `basename`. The data in the basepath should follow this naming convention: `basename.*`, e.g. `basename.dat` and `basename.session.mat`. The clustered data can be in a sub directory, defined in `session.spikeSorting.relativePath` or in the basepath, All files generated by CellExplorer will be saved to the basepath. The raw ephys data should also be stored in the basepath. It is recommended to follow the naming convention: `/path_to_data/basename/`, meaning that the directory containing the dataset is named `basename`, but it is not required. 

## Raw data file format
CellExplorer supports raw binary data files (.dat files). This format is also supported by IntanTech, OpenEphys, KiloSort, Phy, NeuroSuite, Spyking Circus, NeuroSuite, Klustakwik, and many other tools.

Suppose you have N channels:

$$ c_1, c_2, ... , c_N $$

And if you assume that $c_i(t)$ is the value of channel $c_i$ at time $t$, then your data file should be a raw file with values:

$$ c_1(1), c_2(1), ... , c_N(1), c_1(2), ..., c_N(2), ... c_N(T) $$

This is simply the flatten version of your recordings matrix, with size $N x T$.

The related metadata is specified in the session struct:

* __Precision__ (the numeric data type): `session.extracellular.precision`. The default precision is `int16`, but  numeric data types that Matlab supports are included: `double`, `single`, `uint16`, `int32`, `int64`.
* __Number of channels__: `session.extracellular.nChannels`.
* __Sampling rate__: `session.extracellular.sr`.
* __Least significant bit__: `session.extracellular.leastSignificantBit`. The range/precision in µV. Intan system: 0.195µV/bit.

CellExplorer also uses a `basename.lfp` file - A low-pass filtered and down-sampled raw data file for lfp analysis (for efficient data analysis and data storage; typically down-sampled to 1250Hz). The lfp file is automatically generated in the pipeline from the raw data file - using the script `ce_LFPfromDat`). The sampling rate is specified in the session struct (`session.extracellular.srLfp`). The LFP file has the same channel count and scaling as the dat file.

## Matlab data structures
Each type of data is saved in its own MATLAB structure, please see the list of data containers in the next section.

### Session metadata
